# Certificates
A simple database management system for my work. It is stores a list of certificates of products we sell


==============INFO==============
This programm doesn't belong for public uses and develop only for personal work project. 
But you can (if you find my shit-code useful) use it as you wish.

================================

===============DB===============
The programm doesn't work without MySQL database which can not be pulled. 
It is just a fancy wrapper to manage DB.
